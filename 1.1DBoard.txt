1.1 Discussion Board - Source Control

Chosen open source projects:

1.) https://github.com/github/gitignore 

The file .gitignore tells Git which files to ignore when it's time to commit 
your project to the repository in GitHub. It will ignore directories with that particular name.
This link seemed to be the best option to the one required in class.

2.) https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity

This extension allows you to bring GitHub inside of Unity. 
Allowing you to have source control with your work. I chose this one because
even though we are using c++ at the moment and for the majority, c# is still a
language I hope to keep on practicing and hopefully developing with as well in the future.

3.) https://github.com/sebh/UnrealEngineSkyAtmosphere

This project seemed to be a test of a created sky atmosphere. Would love to be able
to run it myself. I want to be able to understand better the game engine I believe I will 
be using the most with c++.

4.) https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer

This program is integrates one of my favorite games, Zelda: Ocarina Of Time. The program seems
to basically grab all of the items in the game and change their location giving a
different approach and feel to the classic. I'm very insterested in the capabilities of 
a good randomizing code and would love to play it or experiment with it.

5.) https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/FPSSample

This is an example of how a First Person Shooter would play out with Unity. I'm interested 
in changing the formula or looks and feels of FPS games. I know games that are RPG/FPS can be
done much better, but before I get to that point, it would be good experience to see how it 
actually plays out in coding.
